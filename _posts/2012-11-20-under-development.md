I'm currently in the process of developing my website. Below is a list of some of the things that I'd like to include in the first version:

* A blog - *as you can see, I've started implementing this already*
* My Curriculum Vitae
* A portfolio displaying examples of my work

I plan to make the layout responsive, but this will be implemented after the other features.
